/** WHAT IS THIS??
 * This is the '!OPENTICKET:dump' command.
 * It's a utility command which can only be used by the creator of Open Ticket or the owner of the bot.
 * This command will send the `otdebug.txt` file in DM. It's not dangerous as the `otdebug.txt` file doesn't contain any sensitive data (only logs).
 * 
 * WHY DOES IT EXIST??
 * This command can be used to quickly get the `otdebug.txt` file without having access to the hosting
 * in case you're helping someone with setting up (or debugging) Open Ticket.
 * 
 * CAN I DISABLE IT??
 * If you want to turn it off, you can always do it below this message!
