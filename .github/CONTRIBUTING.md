These are the Contributing Guidelines of Open Ticket!<br>
Here you can find everything you need to know about contributing to Open Ticket.<br>
This includes new features, translations & bug fixes.

### 💬 Translations
#### Step 1: View & Check
1. Check the [`./languages/`](./languages/) folder for existing translations.
2. When it doesn't exist yet, visit **[step 2](#step-2-translation)**.
3. When it does exist, check if it is outdated, incorrect or incomplete.
4. If you match one of these requirements, you can also visit **[step 2](#step-2-translating)**.

#### Step 2: Translation
1. If your language doesn't exist yet, copy the [`english.json`](./../languages/english.json) file and rename it to your language.
2. **(❌ Not Recommended)** You are allowed to use `Google Translate` or `DeepL`, but only when you say it in the pull request and enable the `"automated"` boolean.
3. Only translate existing values in the json file. Don't add or remove any values from the file.
4. You're **NOT REQUIRED** to translate everything! If you only want to translate a part of it, it's okay!
5. If you are unable to translate something, leave it in `English`.

#### Step 3: Metadata
Metadata can be found in the `_TRANSLATION` variable.
